* Better Youtube Blocking

** Rationale

Unfortunately, youtube does not provide good tools for filtering the
content shown in the recommended feed. There is a "don't recommend
this channel" option, but it is only availible after I have already
been recommended a video which I did not want in my feed.

I'd like to be able to pre-emptively block certain chanels from
showing up in my recommendations at all. It would also be nice to be
able to filter recommendations by tags, keywords, video-length, and
other fields.

This is my attempt at a better solution, using a chrome extension to remove videos from the recommended feed.
