** Project Status

*** DONE Find and filter videos on page

*** TODO Add UI for users to pick channels to block

    Ideally add a "Block with YT-better-blocking" option to the
    existing YT content menu on each video.

    If that turns out to be infeasible, a dropdown in the popup menu
    would work as well. The dropdown should be populated with the
    channel names on the current page.
